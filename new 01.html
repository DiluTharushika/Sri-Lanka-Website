<p> <img src="Sigiriya Rock Fortress Sri Lanka.jpeg"   width="30%"  height="50%" align="right" ><h3>
Sigiriya Rock Fort is utterly impressive. The rock walls 
rise up 200 meters from the ground, only to give way to a flat plateau
 at their summit. There are steep stairwells to reach the top and many frescos 
 to marvel at on the way up. At the top, you can find the remains of an ancient civilization, 
 including relics of a palace and monastery.</h3></p>

<p><h3>It would have taken true engineering ingenuity to build a structure at this height
 so many centuries ago. Around the rock fort are many important caves and gardens; impressively, they
 are some of the first landscaped gardens in the world.</h3></p>
